## The initial pitch

It started as a normal work-day morning, when my
friend [Alessio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessio-lei-815b35192/) comes
out of the blue and asked me to play some CTF.

> Challenge name: VeryMuch RE\
> Description: Implementing my own VM - Can you check if I did it right?\
> \
> **Milestones**
> 1. 15 minutes: player recognizes the implemented virtual machine
> 2. 30 minutes: (the player) starts writing a disassembler
> 3. 1 hour: (the player) has the whole program disassembled
> 4. 1 hour and a half: (the player) understands the logic
> 5. 2 hours and a half: (the player comes up with a) solution

Later in the evening, I picked the challenge up. It was a ELF64 static binary
written in Rust, which implemented a custom Virtual Machine.

Running it would play an animation and then it would ask for a flag. If a parameter was passed, it would output the allowed symbols the flag could contain.

Once opened up in Ghidra, I generated the graph of the main function's Basic BLocks.

Looking at the disassembly, it was easy to spot the Virtual 32bit Registers
including the Virtual Program Counter, which in this case was EBP.

```asm
                                          ; Virtual registers initialization
                                          ; Set all registers to 0
XOR        R8D,R8D                        ; VR0 (Virtual Register 0) = 0
XOR        R9D,R9D                        ; VR1 = 0
XOR        R10D,R10D                      ; VR2 = 0
XOR        R11D,R11D                      ; VR3 = 0
XOR        EBX,EBX                        ; VR4 = 0
XOR        R14D,R14D                      ; VR5 = 0
XOR        R13D,R13D                      ; VR6 = 0
XOR        EAX,EAX                        ; VR7 = 0
XOR        R12D,R12D                      ; VR8 = 0
JMP        VM_START
VM_START:
MOV        EBP,dword ptr [RAX + RCX*4]    ; Load the next instruction in EBP
TEST       EBP,0x40000                    ; Test if the 19th bit of EBP (current instruction) is set
JZ         LAB_SKIP_INS1                  ; If not, skip the next (virtual) instruction
LEA        R12D,[R14 + R13*0x1]           ; VR8 = VR5 + VR6
SKIP_INS1:
MOV        EDX,R13D                       ; Internal VM Logic
IMUL       EDX,R14D                       ; Internal VM Logic
TEST       EBP,0x80000                    ; Test if the 20th bit of EBP (current instruction) is set
CMOVZ      EDX,R12D                       ; Another (virtual) instruction
TEST       EBP,0x20000                    ; Test if the 17th bit of EBP (current instruction) is set
JZ         LAB_SKIP_INS2                  ; If not, skip the next (virtual) instruction
                                          ; More VM code...
```

I was able to locate and dump the bytecode. Each instruction was composed of a dword (4 bytes).

## Giving up

After spending one hour on it, I gave up and told my friend Alessio some clues on how it could be possible to solve the challenge. I was giving up because due to the optimization done by Rust using SIMD instructions, it was too difficult for me to reverse engineer the Virtual Instructions.

      alt="Spongebob heading out meme"

Even though I was confident I could do it, I did not want to spend my time doing something that was steering me away from my studies and my job. Since it was something "I knew how to do", I thought that I would have learned nothing from this and that I would just waste my time playing CTF instead of studying.

      name="giving-up-en.png"
      alt="If only I knew..."
      style="max-height: 50vh"
      caption="If only I knew..." >}}

After this happened, I noticed my girlfriend getting really nervous and histerically laughing. After she suggested to me that this _"May be important"_ and that _"I should continue because it would be impolite to my friend"_ I knew she was cooking something üë©‚Äçüç≥

      caption="I caught her red handed!" >}}


## Down the rabbit hole


Now that I knew there was something more to it other than being just a CTF, I tried to focus more on the SIMD instructions to try to build a correct disassembler for the VM bytecode.

{{< bundle-animated-image name="grandma-hacking.webp" >}}

The SIMD instructions I am referring to are the following:

```asm
; .rodata
VM_MASK1:
DB         0x00,0x00,0x80,0x00,0x00,0x20,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x04,0x00,0x00,0x80,0x00,0x00,0x00
VM_MASK2:
DB         0x10,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x02,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x40,0x00,0x00,0x00,0x08,0x00,0x00

; .text
MOVD       XMM0,EBP    ; Remember that EBP is holding the current instruction
PSHUFD     XMM3,XMM0,0x0
MOVDQA     XMM0,XMM3
PAND       XMM0,xmmword ptr [VM_MASK1]
MOVDQA     XMM1,XMM3
PAND       XMM1,xmmword ptr [VM_MASK2]
PCMPEQD    XMM1,XMM2
PCMPEQD    XMM0,XMM2
PACKSSDW   XMM0,XMM1
PACKSSWB   XMM0,XMM0
PMOVMSKB   ECX,XMM0
TEST       CL,0x80
JZ         VM_INSTR1
TEST       CL,0x40
JZ         VM_INSTR2
TEST       CL,0x20
JZ         VM_INSTR3
```

The program contained two blocks similar to this one. I was not able to understand how EBP was
computed against the mask to then call the right virtual instruction.

To this day, I am still not able to understand how the instructions get decoded üòÇ

**NOTE:** If you understand the logic of this code block,
please [contact me!](mailto:antipatico<at>bootkit<dot>dev)

**{{<color "#578cbf">}}UPDATE{{</color>}}**: I think I may have cracked the code. If so, I will write
a follow up post at some point!

On the bright side, I was able to find some strings at the end of the bytecode, containing the
badboy (`Try Again`), the godboy (`YAYYY`) and what I thought was the start of the flag (`flag{`).

The whole night passed then I went to bed.

## Defeat?

I tried again the same approach the day later, without success. At this point I felt
completely defeated and pretty bad about myself.

Not only I was not able to solve the challenge that was supposed to be easy, but I also
felt I was failing my girlfriend and my friend.

Fortunately, she promptly picked me up and she gave me the force and support to continue.

## Solving it, that's what counts

At this point, I spent many hours on the challenge. It was time to pick another approach. This approach was living rent free in my head from the start and after I got it as a hint on my first give-up I knew it would work: _Side-Channels_.

The basic idea to this strategy is to try to **{{<color "#dea430">}}count the number of instructions{{</color>}}**
the programs executes in its Virtual Machine and compare the results with different
given flag inputs.

I decided to try
to do this with [Intel-PIN](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98612/Pin/doc/html/index.html).
Intel-PIN allows anybody to Dynamic Binary Instrument any target, allowing at a high-level
to add custom instructions after every instruction.

After downloading Intel-PIN source code, I duplicated the `inscount2.cpp` tool and coded the following patch:
```diff

     OutFile.setf(ios::showbase);
-    OutFile << "Count " << icount << endl;
+    OutFile << icount << endl;
     OutFile.close();
 }
```

Using the resulting PIN tool, it was possible to infer the length of the flag. Running the target while
counting the number of instructions ran in the Virtual Machine, it was possible to understand the length
of the flag by observing the instrunctions increasing with the lenght of the given input up until the
39th character.

{{< bundle-image 
      name="side-channel-len.png"
      alt="Intel-PIN execution"
      caption="Executing the target while counting the instructions" >}}

The same approach can be used to bruteforce the right character of the flag. Thanks to the strings I
found in the bytecode before, I was able to test this by replacing the initial characters of the flag
with the expected `flag{`. I was able to notice an increase of the number of instructions executed in
the virtual machine for each right character in the flag üòé

It was just a matter of coding a bruteforce solution, which would run in parallel
n targets with n variations of the flag, while instrumenting the target to count the number of instructions
and in the end pick the flag variation which executed the maximum number of instructions.

```python
def main():
    alphabet=string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation + ' '
    flag="flag{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{}"
    start_index=len("flag{")
    for i in range(start_index, len(flag)-2):
        print(f"FLAG={flag} INDEX={i}")
        variations = generate_variations(flag, i, alphabet)
        with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
            futures = [executor.submit(run_counting_instructions, flag) for flag in variations]
        results = [future.result() for future in futures]
        next_char = alphabet[results.index(max(results))]
        flag = flag[:i] + next_char + flag[i+1:]
        print(f"Found next character: '{next_char}'")
    # For the last character, we check for the output instead of instrumenting the target.
    for flag in generate_variations(flag, len(flag)-2, alphabet):
        if "Try Again" not in run(flag):
            break
    print(flag)
```

It was only a matter of time and eventually the solution would arrive:
