Now that I think about that, tools aren't much different from friends:
they are hard to find and easy to lose, you must _work_ on them if you want
them to be functional, you can't live without them, after a while of *"using"*
one you start seeing its flaws as strengths and in the end it doesn't matter
which one you *"use"* as long as it *"works"* for **you**.

## Deceased projects

Unfortunately, some projects are left unmantained. Nothing lasts forever.
I will keep track of projects that I found useful at some point but that are not
mantained anymore.
